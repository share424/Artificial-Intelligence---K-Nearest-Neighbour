# Artificial Intelligence - K-Nearest Neighbour
An algorithm for classification data, where there are 5 variable and class value between 0 - 3

### Data Train
There are 800 dataset with 5 variable and their class from 0 - 3

### Data Test
There are 200 dataset to test our algoritm

### Tutorial
Open your terminal and type
```
python main.py [K] [save]
```
K is your K value, default is 10

save is boolean (true or false) for save the result to DataTebakan3.csv, default is true
